Today I went to volunteer programme on Mosgiel Library.<br><br>

It was about helping elderly people, with IT stuff. I met Kerri and with short waiting, I met an old lady.

She was struggling with her mobile phone and I looked into it to solve her problem.<br><br>

But what I found was really simple problems such as spam email from Countdown and too many contact numbers for same person. Those problems were really easy to solve, yet this old lady was struggling with them. That was the time I realized that some issues like this does not mean much for me but it can be a problem for elderly people, or people who do not know how to work with IT stuff.<br><br>

Also it was pretty hard to explain about stuff that I thought it was basic. It was really great experience to know about how elderly people communicate with IT environment today, and also made me think about how much do I actually know about things that I called 'basic'. I had trouble to explain about her solution more briefly, effectively, and it concerned me about my knowledge.
