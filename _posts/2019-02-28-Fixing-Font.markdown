1. Read "Statistics" page codes to understand how it gets the data and displays it ![Feb_28_1](/assets/img/Feb_28_1.JPG)

2. Changed fonts colours on "Statistics" page so it can be readable ![Feb_28_3](/assets/img/Feb_28_3.JPG)

3. Changed layout of the "Statistics" page, look more like other pages, specifically like "Edit Details" ![Feb_28_4](/assets/img/Feb_28_4.JPG)

Since I started reading the codes, I realized that some codes are not difficult to understand as I thought it would be. Still I should learn more about mobile programming from mobile course but some part of the codes are actually easy to figure out what they do. I had an idea how to fix the issue with "statistics" page crashing the app and tried to fix it, and I failed to do at this point.
