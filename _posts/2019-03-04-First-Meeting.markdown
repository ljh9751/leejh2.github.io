1. Project meeting
2. GitLab is down
3. I finished half of his ticket. "Splash screen to pop up at start"

It was light working day as Flinn and I still struggled to run through lines of codes to figure out how the activities are working in order.<br><br>
However, after the meeting, we decided working on whole new task as Adon taught us about the progression of our application which has higher priority then other issues that I thought I need to working on at this point.<br><br>
After some googling, I found out how to show splash screen at first but time ran out before I could finish it in the class. I will finish it as soon as possible.
