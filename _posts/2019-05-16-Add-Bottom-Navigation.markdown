1. Joon finished adding bottom menu navigation.

Today, with Adon's suggestion, I added a bottom navigation bar for our app. I just followed the instruction that can be searched on google by [react native bottom navigation bar](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/bottom-navigation.html)

I will work on the screens based-on this bottom navigation bar codes because I am not sure how to work on the normal page and add this codes to work together yet.
