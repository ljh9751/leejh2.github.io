Today, we started the class with usual scrum.

After that, I worked on my ticket and succeeded to put three tabs on one page as a test project.

I might need to use more than three pages since the goal time slots are daily, weekly, monthly and yearly.

Beside this, Flinn and I found out about something really important.
Adon and Grayson tought us about Leon's formula, which was why Leon requested this health application.
Flinn and I did not know about this and we found a python file that has Leon's formula, inside old project from last mobile development crew.

We went through this formula and found out that step counting wasn't even in the formula so it was not necessary.
It made me feel like I spent long time on useless feature but I decided to just ignore that fact and thought those times as good studying experience.
