Today, we started the class with usual scrum.

After that, I worked on my ticket and succeeded to put three tabs on one page as a test project.

I might need to use more than three pages since the goal time slots are daily, weekly, monthly and yearly.

Beside this, Flinn and I found out about something really important.
