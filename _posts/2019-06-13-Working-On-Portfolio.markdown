1. Joon worked on portfolio, on jekyll

Today, I assembled most of the portfolio materials from wiki page of our project.

I tried to use gitlab with jekyll, following tutorials from moodle page, but it did not work properly so I used github instead.<br>

Now, my portfolio is up-to-date and I will record progress on jekyll pages from now.<br>

However, I haven't figure out how to make these pages online so I need to figure that out.
