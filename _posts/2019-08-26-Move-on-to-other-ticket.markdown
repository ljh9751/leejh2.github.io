For last week, I kept working on Step Counter even though the Sprint finished, but can not figure out how to fix the error.
I have a new ticket which is 'Feature 19 - Store user goals into firebase' as well so I was spending quite much time on Project 2 stuff.

So I discussed about this with Flinn and Grayson multiple times and we all agreed on skipping Step Counter for now since we cannot solve its problem.

I feel bad about this because it was my ticket, my responsibility to finish on time and I couldn't do it.
Flinn did finish other tasks that he was assigned to do and it made me feel a bit angry on myself.

I need to do better than this.
