1. Adon and my group had a meeting
2. We decide to work on our project with totally new language called "React Native"
3. We will study about React Native from now on

Adon and my group had a meeting and the main problem about our project came up on the surface which was about uploading the app on Google App Store.<br>
It was a major problem that Flinn worked on during 2 or 3 weeks which was not solvable for some reason.

As the screenshot shows, the app can be seen on the desktop condition but it can not be shown in the app store and even though make it to be seen, no one can download the app.<br>

Therefore, during the meeting, Adon suggested us to work on the same project with another way of programming, React Native.

React Native acts like an app but actually it shows web pages that can be seen as an app on the mobile device.<br>

We agreed on working with React Native since we cannot figure out the problem with Google App Store, as well as the reason that React Native is a new way of mobile programming which can be a trend soon.
