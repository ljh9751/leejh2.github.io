Today is the last day I worked on our project, and this portfolio.

During last two weeks, I completed Goals page to show features it needs to do, and Flinn and I was successful on sending our app to Google Store.
I created a logo for our app using public domain image, tweaked by photoshop.

Only thing we have left is waiting for our app to appear on the store and project debrief on this Friday.

It was really wholesome semester for me because I can see I improved a lot on using React Native and Google Firebase Realtime Database.
I feel like I learned many knowledges and used it properly during this class and feel happy that Flinn and I were able to finish the app in time.
Still there are many features need to be added but we did the best we can do at this point, and if I have a chance after the graduation, I wish to do more work on our app.

It is really strange feeling that I am feeling now, because I have an app on Google Store, that I never expected to experience.

Also this Project 2 class made me realize that I need more work on my skills on IT, because of some failures during works.
I learned that I need to think about my work more in depth as well. Some works that I did were taken out because it was not necessary, and it was a bit of waste of time.
For next time, when I work with other people like this, I should think more carefully about my work, rather than just do it first and figure out it was not important at all.

Other then those important lessons, it was really hard but fun class that I will remember for long time.
