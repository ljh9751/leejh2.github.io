Today, Flinn and I decided to work on multiple of light tickets. I chose to work on 'Feature 11 - Add information to the "About" page' and 'Feature 17 - Store user walk/run information into database'.

The reason we chose to light tickets was that there were other assignments to do.
So naturally I worked on About page first, since it was just adding some information about Flinn and I.

It was so easy because I've working with React Native almost 8 months and I am so used to create a page.
