Adon reassigned us as "reporter" to the repo "wlking with leon". <br>
He lent us a phone to test the app before walking on it.<br>
Flinn and I struggled to install SDK to run the application using android studio<br>
While we doing that, we tried to use the app on the phone, pre-installed version<br><br>
We found several errors including

- Large X button after entering the details, leads to "Statistics" screen
- "Statistics" screen does not walk, not showing any numbers even though used "Walk" to walk some steps
- back button actually go back to back, rather than close the app or something like that.
- Timer on "Walk" stops around 1, or at least not showing 0, and no alerts at all for it

We ran a new app on the phone and whole new version appeared

Still we found some stuffs
- Timer still stops at 1 without alert user

- Step counting stops when the user pause the timer and not resuming after user resumes the timer
- "Goals" pages shows nothing
- Walk without timer does not count steps
- Option page does not show the fonts, but the buttons are there
- Since the timer stops at 1, user can not record the data
- Stop button (Square button) is not working
- "Walking with timer" activated while "walking without timer" is activating.

As Flinn and I run through the app, we recognized that some parts of app is not working at all and some parts are working but partially not working.<br>
It seems like difficult task for me complete this project because there are a lot of works to do and I have no clue how to fix those.
