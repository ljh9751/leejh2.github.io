After two weeks (week 9 and 10) of fixing some little layout issue and working on other assignments, I had a 2 weeks holiday.

I spent whole holiday to finish other assignments and rest a bit, so I can start new ticket today.

My new work is 'Feature 24 - Add tabs on Goals page', which was my idea.
I thought since we have diffrent time slots for goals, we can show each goal on each page.
For example, user will see daily goal on daily tab, weekly goal on weekly tab and so for.

Also I actually found [good repo](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-tab-view) that shows good features such as swipping.

So today, I tried to apply this module by recreating simple page with three tabs and it wasn't successful.
I still need more study on applying those kind of repo materials on my project.
