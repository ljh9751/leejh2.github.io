1. Joon and Flinn decided to run through the current condition of the application.
2. Albert taught us about how to upload the app on the Google Play Store.
3. Flinn will upload the app while Joon keeps working on the app

Today, we discuss how the app is at this point and what we need to work on after this sprint.<br>

While our discuss, we talked with Albert and realized that we need an ID and password for BIT student and there are some steps to go through. Thanks to Albert, he lead us to his website that has all the steps (even thought it might be an old version).

After the talk, we decide to work on separate work and I will keep working on the task I previously worked on, pause button.
