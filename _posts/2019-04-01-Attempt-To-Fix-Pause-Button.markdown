1. Joon managed the step counter to not count steps when the pause button is pressed

After some reading of codes, I found out there is a method that cares about pausing timer.

I added simple code...

and it made the step counter stops working when pause timer pressed!<br>

However, I think this is not the right way and it is confirmed, by the fact that after pause button pressed, pressing play button does not resume the step counter. I should work on this more to get it perfectly right.
