Today is the last day of Project 1, and I want to reflect on what happened during this semester, on my Project 1 class.<br><br>

From the beginning, I couldn't decide which project group was good for me, because I had two groups that I want to be in. First pick from me was actually operations and security. During my class on security and Linux, I found myself that the contents were not that hard, compare to Programming 4 and such. So I naturally tried to be in a group that do the familiar and "seems to be easy" materials.<br><br>

However, I was also considering to be in mobile project because I was just interested in mobile development. I, myself, uses a lot of application on my android phone and I think the market for mobile application is getting larger and larger. In terms of that fact, it would be really good choice to work on mobile project so I can learn about new and "popular" material on current days.<br><br>

However, I decided to join in mobile project group because there were no place on operations and security left. I was ok with either group so actually it was really good that I did not have to choose specific project.<br><br>

After that, there was another choice between working on the application that someone else worked on first, or working on the fresh application. This choice was somehow easy decision for me because I wanted to continue the project that someone else worked on. I thought, and still think, it was a good choice because in real life, I will probably working on the project that someone else wrote it long time ago. I should be able to work around this kind of circumstance to be able to get a job and work well.<br><br>

Therefore, the project that I've given was "Walking with leon", the application about exercise by walking. The aim of the application was to record user's route through the walking session, record the distance and calculate how much calories the user used etc. It was straight forward and looked like a lot of works were done<br><br>

But during half of the semester, all I could do was changing layouts and fixing some buttons issue. All the codes were not commented properly or not commented at all. My low level of knowledge on mobile developing was also an issue. As a learner of mobile development, it was actually great opportunity and I gradually improved my skills by using knowledge from mobile development class on project. The problem occurred on the middle of the semester. Flinn, my group member, tried to push our app on the Google Play Store and it was not working properly. He struggled several days on it and it was necessary task to be done as quick as possible.<br><br>

At that point, we discussed the issue on the meeting with Adon and everything changed. Adon suggested to make an application from the scratch, which is not really cause we have all the screens and enough information, with using a new language for us, React Native. It was a whole new language that I never heard of, which was actually not "that" foreign. It uses javascript and I worked on these kind of language before. Also there were a lot of tutorials on how to use React Native and it was really helpful.<br><br>

Recently, I am still trying to understand and applying what I learned from those tutorial to work properly on our app, but it gives me so many great experiences. The project is far from completion but I feel like I learned how to adapt to the environment where the whole project moves to another language. I don't know when but this kind of experiences will be a great help for me in real job environment.<br><br>

Overall, I already talked about my feelings on various posts so I just wrote about general feelings during Project 1 on this post.<br>
I had a lot of bad and good moment during classes and I feel like I learned so much about working in stress condition as well as working together with someone else, on someone's command and working with customer who wants me to do something. It was quite fresh experience as I only worked on assignments not "work" until I took Software Engineering last semester, which I struggled a lot to adapt. <br><br>

Project 1 was actually easier for me to work with because of last semester's experience but still not easy. But it helped me to work with teams, using git labs and write documentaion like this post so I am positivie that I am improved and will improve my skills as a IT student on next semester.
