After few assignments, I finally finished working on Goals page, for now.

First of all, I added the function to store user's goal distance to Google Firebase, for each time slot.

After that, I fixed Goals page to have four TextInputs and button to press, so user can edit goals anytime.

At this moment, this page seems done because Flinn and I discussed about add step goals and decided not to apply at this moment.
We need to check user's activity and compare user's current distance walked to user's goal distance but we don't know how to do it yet.

We decided to create another ticket to work on this later.
