Today, we had another scrum.

![Scrum picture](/assets/img/Week_14_2_1.png)

After that, Flinn and I discussed about our app and the time we left to finish it.
During that conversation, we decided to not use the ring-shaped progress bar since it would take long time to implement it successfully.
Also we figured that if user can have one goal, we don't really need to specify as 'weekly'.
So the idea is that make user can have one goal at a time and move on to next when he/she acheive current goal.

Therefore, I started work on that which might be the last feature I will work on our app before launching to Google Store.

I created simple page with some layout copied from Home page that Flinn designed, to have similar layout throughout the app.

![new Goals page](/assets/img/Week_14_2_2.jpg){: width="300" height="600"}

At the bottom, I will add simple calculation so user can see how much he/she did finish, to acheive chosen goal, by percentage.
