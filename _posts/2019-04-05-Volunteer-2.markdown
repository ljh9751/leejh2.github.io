Today, I went to volunteering programme again.<br><br>

It was re-purposing the computers for future students on Otago Polytechnic, on third floor on D department.<br><br>

The working for 2 hours were kind of boring, but it was good to do some hardware-related works. I tried to figure out what was wrong with, about 5 PCs, and fixed 2. The ones that I couldn't fix were the ones without DDR4 RAM or broken PSU, which were not able to fix just by myself.
