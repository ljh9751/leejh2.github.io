After one week of working on adding tabs on Goals page, including Labour day, I still couldn't add tabs on our Goals page.

There were other assignments to do but it was not the reason why I couldn't finish this ticket.
I found few reasons that we might not need to feature for our app.

Those reasons are including:
- Too many goal time lots, since it seems unnecessary to many users
- Even if we show goals individually, there are not much things to show on screen

Therefore, I tried to discuss this with Flinn and Grayson, and we figured that we might need to have only one goal, weekly goal.
But still we will use two tabs on our Goal page, one for edit user goal and other one for showing current progress.

This choice made more work for me to do since I need to figure out current progress of user but still it is important feature so I should work on it fast.
