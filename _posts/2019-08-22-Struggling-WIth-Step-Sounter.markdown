I am still working on Step counter as it does not work properly.

From last post, I found another module that tweaked the repo from previous post, which is [this repo](https://github.com/JWWon/react-native-universal-pedometer).
This repo was fairly recent and looks more appliable to me.

However, it was not working as I want it to work. The main problem is that step is counting, but not in real time.
So basically, the step goes up few seconds after user moved.

At first, I thought the step counter doesn't work at all but I saw step counter goes up with delays.
I have no idea why it does this and how to solve this at this moment.
