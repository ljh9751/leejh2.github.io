Today, Flinn and I set the first milestone, 'Sprint 1' which will be held about 10 days.

My ticket for 'Sprint 1' was 'Feature 5 - Create database that stores a user's information'.

We decided to use Google Firebase as our external database for our app.
There was some webpages about React Native integrated with Google Firebase so it was not hard to find the information about those stuff.

However, there were some errors I met during setting up the environment for Google Firebase including below errors

So I googled about this error and I had to do some configuration to solve the issue.

After those configuration, I could be able to turn on the project with Google Firebase module installed (nothing is working yet)

For next part, I will set some settings on Google Firebase, Database for particular.
