1. Flinn sent a merge request to original repo and merge was successful.
2. Joon tried to do the same but failing it.

Today, I struggled to merge my version to original repo because I had no idea how to pull the original version, with Flinn's work, to my 'forked' repo. I need to do that in order to send my merge request and I failed to do it, even though I followed an instruction on google search.

I asked about this to Albert, and he suggested to use branch rather than forking but I am unsure I can do that or not. Flinn and I need to discuss this with Adon before working into more complex part of project.
