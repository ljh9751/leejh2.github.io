Today, I went the third volunteer programme, on [Age Concern Otago](https://ageconcernotago.com/).

In today's session, I talked with old gentleman, who was really generous to me.<br><br>

He had a problem with remember things, due to his brain surgery from not-long-ago, and therefore he wants to note down every detail on how to fix his problems with mobile phone operating. I tried to solve his problem, which were deleting photos that were tied as albums and can not be deleted individually and delete some contacts that he does not need to keep any more.<br><br>

He and I finished solving problems as well as note down all the process through that, but I felt not enought because of my lack of skills on speech and teaching. I might be more fluent on talking as well as teaching and maybe he felt more comfortable.<br><br>
