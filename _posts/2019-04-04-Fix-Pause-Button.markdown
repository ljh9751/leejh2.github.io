1. Joon made 'pause' button on 'Scroll1' working with 'play' button

Today I showed the code to Adon and he pointed out that "StepCounter" method only has two options to deal with where there are three buttons, start, pause and stop button.<br>

After hearing that, I added simple if statement on "stepCounter" method.

Adding this codes will make the step counter to start, resume, pause and reset when "isWalking" state's condition. I made sure this method is called on each button and it worked! Time counter and step counter does whatever the buttons let them to do and it was a great feeling that I fixed something complex.<br>

It is really good progress in learning about android programming because I am learning from this project as well as mobile class and each part made me realize more about how to do stuff. Specially, as the mobile class progress, more and more codes from project application gets more understandable to me and it makes me happy.
