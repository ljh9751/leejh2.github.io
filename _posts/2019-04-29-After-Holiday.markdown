1. Joon continues to work on the timer, especially on timer1

As a first class after the holiday, I started slow on this day as keep reading and trying to understand the codes from former programmer.<br>

During the class, Adon suggested that instead of showing 00:00:00, I can show some kind of alert or toast with screen change for user convenience, which seems like a great idea.<br>

Once I figure out the codes, I probably will add a pop up box that shows some kind of message like "Well done" and change the intent to statistics page.
