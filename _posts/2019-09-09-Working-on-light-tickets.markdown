Today, Flinn and I decided to work on multiple of light tickets. I chose to work on 'Feature 11 - Add information to the "About" page' and 'Feature 17 - Store user walk/run information into database'.

The reason we chose to light tickets was that there were other assignments to do.
So naturally I worked on About page first, since it was just adding some information about Flinn and I.

It was so easy because I've working with React Native almost 8 months and I am so used to create a page.

![About Us page](/assets/img/Week_8_1_1.jpg){: width="300" height="500"}

After finishing that, I tried to work on next ticket and succeed on adding current activity data of user.

![activityData](/assets/img/Week_8_1_2.JPG)

I decided to use date as a activity label so we can see what date user did what activity clearly.

Before almost done, Flinn and I came up with another problem and it was about showing user's latest activity at Home page.
Adon suggested us to have some kind of display that can be seen at initial page, that shows user's statistics about activities.

Therefore the date structure I used above became a bit of a problem since it makes get the recent data of user difficult.
All the '-' and seconds will make it harder for us to figure out the latest activity of a user.

I am not sure how to apply this 'latest activity' feature yet, so I will need more time to think about it.
