1. Joon started working on "Timer stops at 1"

Just before the mid-semester holiday, I started to work on the ticket called "Timer stops at 1" which means that when the timer stops, the timer does not show 00:00:00, and shows 00:00:01 as a stop timing.<br>

It seems like because the timer stops working before the timer changes to 00:00:01 to 00:00:00 so it just shows 00:00:01 even though it worked more than that.<br>

However, I ran through the codes but have no idea which part of the codes actually does effect that procedure. I probably need more skills on the mobile app coding.
