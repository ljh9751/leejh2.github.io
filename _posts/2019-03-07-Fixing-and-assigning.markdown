1. We finished simple tasks
 - Joon finished working on "Splash screen to pop up at start"
 - Flinn finished working on "Design layout login page"

2. Newly assigned tasks are
 - Joon: Make splash screen to go login page
 - Flinn: Make login page to go right page on button click
 - Both: Create stable version for uploading on Google Store

After I struggled a bit to get my task done, it turned out it was not a hard task at all. I just need to modify 'AndroidManifest.xml' to set the first activity that will be shown when the application opens.

Splash screen was already inside the application but did not called by any activity so it was actually simpler task to do.<br><br>
Now, the new task will be redirecting to the login page, from splash screen and after that, release our application on the Google Play Store
