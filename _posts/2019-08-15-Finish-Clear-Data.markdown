Today I finished Clear Data, for now.

After last post, I tried to make Clear Data page to make certain information of user to become empty string, instead of null.

It was working fine, but I had a doubt that this is what Clear Data is for.
Why would a user want to delete their details, even though they have a login account?
So I talked about this with Flinn and Grayson. 

After some discusstion, we all agreed that the data we need to clear might be the data from activity that user did, rather than personal information.

Therfore, we need to figure out what to clear later, after we add more features such as timer.
