1. Joon majorly worked on other subject's assessment
 - Adon gave me an idea about documentation, adding diagram for app structure and explanation of what the app's screens are doing.

Today, I had a lot of works on other subject so I worked on them rather than project works, because most of other works were due near future.<br>

However, I had a simple discusstion with Adon and He gave me an idea about documentation for our application.<br>

I will add tree diagram for our application and describe what each screen does.
