Today, I took the new ticket about counting steps for user's activity.
I had to research about pedometer which is a sensor that senses user's step.

The problem was that there was not good pedometer module for React Native Android app.

There were few modules but they were outdated and not working at all.

[This repo](https://github.com/smekalka/react-native-universal-pedometer) and [this repo](https://github.com/AsserData/react-native-universal-pedometer) was only repos that have decent README and compatible with Android but they were not working as well.

Also I struggled to use this module on our app since I couldn't apply them properly.
I realized that I have a bit of problem understanding README on those repos since they are so wide, without proper explanation how to use those modules.

I need to do more research to get this done, or I might not able to do step counting.
