1. Joon started working on "Pause and Stop buttons on timer, on "Scroll1", are not working properly"
 - I will work on "Pause" button first

I started working on the "Pause" button on "Scroll1". The problem is that this pause button stops the countdown but not the step counter.

This is the codes about counting steps and I somehow need to fix this. I have no clue how this is working so I will need quite a time to understand this.
