1. Joon cannot work out the merge, so Joon just added his work to the project that has merged contents from Flinn
2. Albert created new repo and I uploaded fully copied version from original repo

So today, I had to do some works again due to merge failing, with forked repo. After Albert discussed about this issue with Adon, Flinn and I will use new copied repo from original application repo, with two separate branches.

Other then that, nothing special happened.
