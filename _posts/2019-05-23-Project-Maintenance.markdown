1. Joon modified the app to have multiple js files for each pages
 - Change and add icons and colours which make an app looks like the original application
2. Flinn started working on using GPS map
3. We had a meeting(Finish works until next Tuesday)

Today, I talked with Grayson, our project manager, and decided to make a multiple js files to seperate all the pages into indivicual file so they can be managed easily.<br>

I struggled to work on it because I worked on the project based on codes from official React Native website, which only use one file to do all the navigation.<br>

However, I found another [helpful website](https://aboutreact.com/react-native-bottom-navigation/) and work with it to fix that issue, and now our project have multiple js files.
