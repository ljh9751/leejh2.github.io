1. Joon finished navigation (sort of), and now will work on adding layouts on pages to be ready for functions
2. Flinn will work on adding timer with new map, leaflet

In this class, I finally finished making simple pages with all navigation, except login page.<br>

Now, users can navigate through our application pages freely with bottom navigation and buttons on page if it has them.<br>

For next task, I will work on texts and boxes that do not have any functions yet but visually visible to work with.
