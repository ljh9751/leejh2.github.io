Today, we had usual scrum during class but one of the new Project 1 student, Hua, wanted to took a picture.

For my ticket, I need to figure out what kind of Goals user can have, before work on it.

So I discussed this with Flinn and we decide to have daily, weekly, monthly and Yearly goals for user.
Each goal should be the distance that user walked and steps he/she took during activity.

However, I need to slow down on Project 2 working since I have other assignments from other papers to work on.
This ticket is for new sprint so I can work in my own pace, not like last time.

I just added some texts on Goals page for now.
