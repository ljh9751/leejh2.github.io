1. Flinn is absent due to sickness (however he worked at home)
 - Flinn will upload the app on Google Play Store

2. Joon is working on pause button on "Scroll2"
 - Joon manages to fix pause button and stop button on both "Scroll1" and "Scroll2"

I moved and started working on "Scroll2" buttons, where some codes are different due to different style of timer.<br>

However, the step counter part were similar and even though some structure was different from "Scroll1" it was not too difficult to find where I should put the codes about buttons and step counting method. Therefore, now both "Scroll1" and "Scroll2" has step counter that are working as they intend to do.<br>

After that, Flinn said that our app is uploaded and in pending condition before fully uploaded on the Google Play Store. It feels strange that the app that I am working on will be published to all the users around the world, even though the application is not perfect in anyway.
