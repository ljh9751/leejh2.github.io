1. Joon added background color as well as font colors for the screens, and started working on "Settings" page by adding three buttons.

During today's class, Grayson, new project manager, helped me to work with React Native more clearly by using plugins on Visual Studio Code, as well as some advice on using other pages for each screens.<br>

However, it was not easy to work on that aspect because as I wrote on last journal, I am not 100% sure and can change the coding to add the bottom navigation on the normal codes yet so Grayson and I decided to work on this base for now.<br>

Nearly end of the class, I successfully changed background colours and font colours of bottom nav as well as all the screens. I also added three buttons on Settings screen with icons to represent what those buttons do.
