After last class, I studied about this Google Firebase and how to use it for our app, 'Taking Steps'.

I was struggling to understand how to use it with React Native but I found a [website](https://blog.jscrambler.com/integrating-firebase-with-react-native/) that helped me.

My group will use the Realtime Database feature of Google Firebase to store any user data.

After all settings done, I followed the tutorial from website above and tested it. To start with, I created a page for adding data to database and tested it.

I checked our database and I was able to see my 'Test' text stored on our database, with earlier tests.

Finally, I deleted all data and added bunch of names on database for final test.

After this success, it made me realise that the coding seems getting easier, in terms of technology.
When I studied about C++ in Programming 4, it was really hard to grasp the concepts of it.
However, for this 'using external database' objective, all I need to do was do some settings and add few lines of codes that can easily understand.
I cannot feel sure that now I am used to programming stuff so it seems easy or it is actually easy.
